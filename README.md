# Photo&Video Sorter
A quick python 3.9 script for sorting photos and videos. Can be modified for any filetype!

You place the sorter.py in the base folder, where you have your photos and videos (in my case, I have them sorted by years). It then goes through all the folders in the base folder, creates Video and Photo directories and then finally separates filetypes into their respective folders.
